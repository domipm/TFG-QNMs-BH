'''
Improved AIM algorithm (IAIM) taylored for computing quasinormal modes (QNMs)
of black holes (BHs).
Focused on solving second-order SchrÃ¶dinger-like equation already written in the "AIM" form:

d^2/dx^2 psi(x) = lambda_0(x) d/dx psi(x) + s_0(x) psi(x)

Therefore, we have to compute the parameters lambda_0 and s_0 beforehand manually
(rewriting the potential in appropriate coordinates and including explicitly boundary conditions
into the solution, that is, incoming waves at horizon and outgoing at infinity)

(Possible improvement: code to compute lambda_0 and s_0 for any kind of potential)

Inputs / Initial parameters:

    -   lambda_0, s_0 - > Expressions of initial parameters lambda_0 and s_0 in terms of only numeric values and symbolic coordinate (x)
    -   x_0           - > Point of evaluation (x0) around which to perform series expansion / substitutions

    ~   (Perform all substitutions in main code) Numeric values of all parameters included in lambda_0 and s_0 (such as mass, spin, angular momentum, etc.)

Options:

    -   re_sign, im_sign - > What solutions to filter (positive real part, negative imaginary, etc.)
    -   alg = sym/num    - > What algorithm to use to solve the polynomial (algebraic/symbolic or numeric solutions)  
    -   n_iter           - > Number of iterations to perform
    -   prec             - > Decimal places to display

Outputs:

    -   Array of all filtered/unfiltered solutions (complex frequencies omega) ordered by mode number (n)
    -   Total computation time
    -   Text update that ensures program is not stuck in loop
    -   Optional additional parameters/values of interest
    -   Write to file

Algorithms implemented:

    * Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM)
    
    * Improves Asymptotic Iteration Method (IAIM)

Tested for:

    -   ...
